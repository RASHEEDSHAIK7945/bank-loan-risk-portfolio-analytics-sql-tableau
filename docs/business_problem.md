# Business Problem

## Background
Banks provide loans to millions of customers. A crucial part of running a bank’s lending business is assessing and managing risk — especially the risk of loan defaults. If too many customers default, the bank can lose money and face financial instability. For investors and executives, understanding loan risk helps in setting interest rates, improving credit criteria, and making strategic decisions about lending portfolios.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a bank’s loan portfolio to:

- Identify trends in loan defaults.
- Evaluate risk exposure across different customer segments.
- Understand the impact of borrower credit scores and loan types on default probability.
- Provide actionable insights that help improve credit decision strategies and portfolio performance.

## Stakeholders
This analysis is useful for:

- **Credit Risk Managers** — to monitor high-risk segments.
- **Business Leadership** — to decide on loan policies and strategies.
- **Data Analysts / BI Team** — to build reports for ongoing monitoring.
