📊 Executive Overview – Chart Selection Rationale
1. Visualization Objective

The Executive Overview dashboard is designed to provide immediate visibility into the overall health of the loan portfolio.
The primary focus is on clarity, speed, and simplicity, enabling executives to understand key metrics at a glance without navigating detailed visuals.

2. Selected Visualization Type

All metrics in this dashboard are presented as KPI cards to emphasize headline values rather than analytical comparisons.

3. KPI-to-Visualization Mapping
